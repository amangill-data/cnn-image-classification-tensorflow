# CNN Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project implements and compares convolutional neural networks for classifying image datasets including MNIST and CIFAR-10 using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Context:

Developed as a midterm project for the course **ADTA 5550: Deep Learning with Big Data** in Spring 2025.

## Project Structure:

- `notebooks/ADTAFINAL.ipynb`  
  Main notebook for training and evaluating CNN models on image datasets.

- `notebooks/ADTAFINALP2.ipynb`  
  Follow up notebook exploring alternative architectures or experiments.

- `ADTA5550_final_project.docx`  
  Final project report including methodology, results, and analysis.

## Dataset Overview:

This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32Ã—32 color images across 10 classes.
It is loaded directly in the notebook using the keras.datasets.cifar10 module, so no manual download is required.

## Key Concepts:

- Convolutional Neural Networks 
- TensorFlow and Keras implementation
- Dataset preprocessing and normalization
- Model training, evaluation, and comparison
- Overfitting mitigation strategies

## Results Summary:

The final report includes:
- Training and testing accuracy comparison
- Architecture selection rationale
- Performance evaluation across datasets

## Tools & Libraries: 

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
